### How to Replicate Figma Design in React Native
- Create a React Component and .jsx file
- Right Click the Layer on figma containing all the sublayers you need and select "Copy as CSS (all Layers)"
- Go to ChatGPT and ask to translate the CSS to a React Native Stylesheet
- Paste the stylesheet into the .jsx file
- In App.js, import your component
- Replace whatever is in the app section with you're component to see if it looks right
